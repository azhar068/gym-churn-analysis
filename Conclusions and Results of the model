Summary Report: Gym Member Dropout Prediction

1. Data Overview and Conclusion
- The dataset contains 10,000 gym members with features like age, gender, sessions per week, session duration, progress score, mood, injury, and dropout status. After preprocessing and removing missing values, 1,994 rows were used for modeling.
- Machine learning models predicted dropout with about 60% accuracy. The most important factors influencing dropout were progress score, session duration, age, and sessions per week. Targeted interventions for members with low progress or short session durations could help reduce dropout rates.

2. Type of Learning
- Supervised learning (predicting dropout using labeled data).

3. Regression Technique
- Logistic regression (for binary classification: dropout vs. non-dropout).

4. Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

5. Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC Curve and AUC

6. Accuracy of Analysis
- Logistic Regression: 58.9%
- Random Forest: 61.9%

7. Key Points
- The models were better at predicting non-dropouts than actual dropouts.
- The most important factors influencing dropout were progress score, session duration, age, and sessions per week.
- The analysis provides actionable insights for gyms to improve retention through data-driven strategies.
